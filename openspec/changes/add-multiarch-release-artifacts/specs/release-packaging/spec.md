#### Scenario: Linux x64 artifact generation
- **WHEN** building a release on Linux x64
- **THEN** release assets include x64 `.deb`, `.rpm`, and `.AppImage` files

#### Scenario: Linux arm64 artifact generation
- **WHEN** building a release on Linux arm64
- **THEN** release assets include arm64 `.deb`, `.rpm`, and `.AppImage` files

### Requirement: macOS Multi-Architecture and Universal dmg
The system SHALL produce macOS x64, arm64, and universal dmg artifacts in release builds.

#### Scenario: macOS x64/arm64 dmg generation
- **WHEN** building releases for macOS x64 and arm64
- **THEN** release assets include dmg files for each corresponding architecture

#### Scenario: macOS universal dmg generation
- **WHEN** running a universal build
- **THEN** release assets include a universal dmg

### Requirement: Parallel Windows MSI and Squirrel Artifacts
The system SHALL generate both Squirrel installer artifacts and MSI artifacts in Windows release builds.

#### Scenario: Windows MSI generation
